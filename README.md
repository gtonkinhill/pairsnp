# pairsnp

A set of scripts for very quickly obtaining pairwise SNP distance matrices from multiple sequence alignments using sparse matrix libraries to improve performance.

For larger alignments such as the Maela pneumoccocal dataset (3e5 x 3e3) the c++ version is approximately an order of magnitude faster than approaches based on pairwise comaprison of every site such as [snp-dists](https://github.com/tseemann/snp-dists).

In order to be most useful implementations in R, python and c++ are available.
